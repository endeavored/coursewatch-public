# coursewatch-public

**The fastest course monitoring tool at Georgia Tech** (probably)

Built in Brittain dining hall during my freshman year in basically one day. The code quality reflects this, but it works.

## Getting started
See `internal/app/coursewatch/cli/cli.go` for the main entry of the code.

## Credit
Have fun and please credit me if used!
