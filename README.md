# coursewatch-public

See `internal/app/coursewatch/cli/cli.go` for the main entry of the code.

This is a public release of my course watch tool which I have been using during my time as an undergrad at Georgia Tech.

Developed in Britain dining hall, this is one of the fastest if not the fastest course monitoring tool at Georgia Tech.

I know the code is not the best quality, but once again keep in mind this was created during freshman year in essentially a day in the dining hall.

Have fun and please credit me if used!
