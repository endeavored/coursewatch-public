# coursewatch-public

**The fastest course monitoring tool at Georgia Tech** (probably)

Built in Brittain dining hall during my freshman year in basically one day. The code quality reflects this, but it works.

## Getting started
See `internal/app/coursewatch/cli/cli.go` for the main entry of the code.

This program will launch jobs that monitor enrollment or waitlist spots in specific classes and notify users via Slack.
To set up, you must set the correct term in the code and attach your Slack webhooks and socket secrets.

## Credit
Have fun and please credit me if used!
